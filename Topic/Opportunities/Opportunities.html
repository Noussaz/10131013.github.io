    <h1><em> Opportunities of Wearable Biosensors</em></h1>
<img src="images/Picture2.png" alt="Wearables"

</ul><p>Wearable biosensors have the potential to completely transform customised healthcare and telemedicine. Wearables can now monitor crucial physiological indications such as temperature, vital signs, body mobility, and molecular biomarkers due to advances in chemical sensing, flexible materials, and scalable production methods. According to David Oâ€™Reilly the Chief Product Officer of Proteus Digital Health he believes that it is critical to innovate for use cases. As right now, everyone is utilising off-the-shelf technology, so they can only pursue obvious things like measuring steps and heartbeats. He also insists on how critical it is to develop a product with a certain use in order to deliver something more significant. Wearable biosensors are seeing more opportunities in the continuous cardiac monitoring of patients, premature new-borns, kids, athletes or fitness enthusiasts, and those living in rural places far from medical and health facilities.  Wearable biosensors have the potential to reduce the pressure on healthcare system by enabling self-monitoring in order to regulate one's health and avoid sickness. Wearable, interconnected biosensors allow for remote monitoring, allowing patients to avoid hospitalization or early discharge. Wearable biosensors can alleviate the stress on healthcare industry and free up hospital space for more responsive treatment by enabling telemedicine. Wearable devices with embedded sensors can provide a much safe and straightforward way for monitoring vital signs. Biosensor patches or tattoos that use conformal, printed electronics can help clinicians collect information on patients for extended periods of time. These sensors work in conjunction with the quantified self-trend to record one's biological data in order to maximise one's health. Wearable biochemical sensors that detect ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in human perspiration have the ability to detect alcohol use. There are also opportunities for large magnetoresistance (GMR) biosensors that allow faster, more efficient detection of illnesses or medications. Laboratory testing health diagnostics processes are often complex, requiring advanced and expensive equipment, expert operators, and a lengthy processing time. With advancements in computer and information technology in recent years, technological applications have led to the rapid development of several wireless and telemedicine applications. According to the National Institute of Health (2015), The health care industry is likely to drive the wearable technology industry, which is predicted to grow from $20 billion in 2015 to up to $70 billion by 2025. With the continuous development of these wearable biosensors, this could decrease the level of deaths caused by heart attacks, strokes and other sudden illnesses in rural areas as well as 3rd World countries. This will also help overpopulated countries and cities like China and India to have a better health monitoring system for the population and as mentioned before this could help people living in places far from hospitals like villagers or farmers where healthcare centres are not available. These wearables could change and help many lives in many different ways. Additionally, these wearables will not only help the patients, athletes and people with health issues, but it will also help the healthcare industry, there will be a better and clearer communication, patients will not have to be prisoners at the hospital which will give more room for emergencies and other urgent cases. Conflicts between expanding populations and limited clinical facilities have resulted in a massive market demand for wearable electronic healthcare equipment. Because of advancements in dependable sensors and logical sensing system design, systematic and statistical research can now be performed to expose the connections of the targeted biomarkers to our physical state. These wearable biosensing technologies hold improvement in terms of achieving body computing for individualized healthcare applications. </p>
