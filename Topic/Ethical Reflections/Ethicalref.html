    <h1><em> Ethical Reflection</em></h1>
</ul><p> The ethical consequences for me regarding these wearables are all connected to the risks and disadvantages mentioned before. Although modern science and healthcare industries have promised that these devices will only help our world and people through monitoring their health levels there is always the doubt and the hesitation. I do strongly believe and agree that the wearables have positively impacted people and continue to do so however, the risk of it causing irritation to someone or the disadvantage of easy access to the confidential data if the item was to be stolen. The device is a very smart and effective invention. Although it is not 100% perfect in terms of it being risks free, however, the results and outcomes of these wearables are very much needed in todayâ€™s world especially. The struggles of overpopulated countries with limited clinical resources have increased the demand of these wearables in the market. As I mentioned before, many have lost their lives due to COVID19, hospitals were full of infected patients and the virus was spreading too fast and is still spreading rapidly in countries like India, due to the lack of clinical resources and people are not aware of their infection. Therefore, I believe that adopting these wearables by the society is very important and convenient at this point, the healthcare industries as well as the government should emphasize the importance of these devices and the government should invest money into the research and the continuous development of the wearable biosensors as it could save many lives and help evolve and improve the medical field. The US National Institute of Health (NIH) has funded many research and have always been pushing and investing into the idea of wearable biosensors. Point-of-care (POC) testing and diagnostics, which offer real-time, remote health monitoring, are a key development area for biosensors. Biosensors make it easier, more accurate, and more sensitive to detect illnesses or infections such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and infectious illness like Coronavirus for example. Microfabricated POC devices will be capable of detecting a wide variety of diseases. POC devices must attain sensitivity similar to lab instruments in order to be utilised as a comprehensive diagnostic tool rather than merely for initial screening of bioagents or diseases. Paper-based biosensors, which reduce the cost and enhance the disposability of biosensors for POC, will see increased demand in poor or developing areas.</p>
