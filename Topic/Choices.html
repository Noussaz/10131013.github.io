    <h1><em> The Choices of Wearable Biosensors</em></h1>
</ul><p>The Wearable biosensors have been a major topic that healthcare industries along with IT industries have been working on for years and continue to do so in order to provide a better and safer device. Some of the pros of wearable biosensors are that it provides continuous monitoring, it is cheap and easy to use and it requires less to no actions from patients, it also has a longer lifetime and it decreases the hospitalization fee and it also gives more space and room to bigger emergencies which is very helpful especially after the COVID19 pandemic it is very important for these devices to be adopted by all countries and especially 3rd world countries which don’t have a good healthcare systems. Thousands have lost their lives due to COVID19 not knowing they were infected, however wearable biosensors could have prevented that by simply monitoring the vital signs of these individuals. Not only it could help prevent deaths but also the spread of the virus especially when people are not aware of the symptoms which is very important. There are many different wearables with different jobs and outcomes which is why the healthcare are pushing for this idea as these wearables’ devices have many jobs and could help in different ways. A very recent addition to these wearables is the rehabilitation wearable devices which is monitors individuals with specific health conditions such as neurological conditions, musculoskeletal conditions and more. This device is very convenient to monitor patients when they are home, and it is great for long-term home-use. wearable sensors currently available in several different forms, such as chest-worn heart-monitoring straps, headbands for measuring brain activity with electroencephalograms (EEGs), posture-detecting monitors, infant and pregnancy monitors for vitals and movement, and electronic patches. These wearables can offer information on the wearer's heart rate, respiration rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure, as well as identify vital sign anomalies that give essential contextual information or feedback.</p>
