    <h1><em> The Risks of Wearable Biosensors</em></h1>

</ul><p> Just like any kind of technologies with disadvantages, wearable biosensors have also their risks, however with the continuous development of machine learning and technologies these risks are able to be fixed. Some of the risks that can be faced with these wearables are cyber risks, technology errors and omissions risk as well as internal body illnesses due to any sort of radiation associated with cancer. One of the main risks that will always be present when a product is related to wireless technology is the Cyber risk, the risk of any kind of data that is taken from the wearables is not carefully protected and secured this will cause the information to be spread it with other individuals that might use it for their own benefit or use it in order to blackmail the government and much more. That is why it is very important for the product developers to work on the security level of these devices as it carries confidential information of patients that could hold an important position in society. 

Many healthcare centres have agreed that the risks and disadvantages of the wearable biosensors are not as major as its advantages as it has showed more help and lifted a burden on the healthcare industry. In order to reduce the risk of cyber and protect the data the developers should at how they could secure the information with more OSs in the cloud which will prevent any data leakage. Although these devices are designed to help the people and monitor vial signs based on the body fluids, designers have promised to keep these devices as safe as possible. Another argument that has risen from the public about the wearables is that it could cause skin cancer and other skin diseases however many doctors have argued that these devices have been made very carefully with high level of protection. Furthermore, research has shown that any kind of wearable devices could cause allergies and other sensitivities like irritation for example which is true, also wearing these devices can cause heat and side effects like headaches. However, doctors will only provide these devices after making sure that it is suitable for the patientsâ€™ situation. multiple technological firms and start-up initiatives have come up to capitalise on the potential economic value of data from sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and pedometers, breath sensing, heart-rate monitors, and calorie trackers. This, however, presents the delicate issue of data ownership as well as the ethical issues of data usage and analysis.

Many have used (EMF) which stands for the electrical and magnetic fields radiation as a rumour and stated that this can cause cancer however as far as the modern science and technology have shown that it causes, nor harm and it is not a concern. Many of the risks that have been mentioned in the past have been resolved due to the continuous developing and changes in technology making the devices safer and more convenient to use, which is why many have been pushing the idea of these wearables and many companies like Samsung, Nike and Apple have been working and investing in this technology..</p>
